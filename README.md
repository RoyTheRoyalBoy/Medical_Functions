# Medical_Functions
These are my implementation of the programs/functions designed for various medical purposes.

To build this program, simply navigate to the root directory and run the following commands: "make all"
To run the tests, type: "./test_EKG", "./test_ETCO2" or "./test_display", depending on which tests you'd like to run
To run the main program, type: "./EKG_simulator", "./ETCO2_simulator" or "./display", depending on which programs you'd like to run

Please refer to image below for further guidance:

Also, please note that the test cases for display was different in a sense that it had no assert statements. I used the outputs on the command line terminal to visually evaluate how my outputs should look. If you would like to see some adjustments on how the output looks, please let me know and I'll try to change it accordingly.
