# Medical_Functions
These are my implementation of the programs/functions designed for various medical purposes.

To build this program, simply navigate to the root directory and run the following commands: "make all"
To run the tests, type: "./test_EKG", "./test_ETCO2" or "./test_display", depending on which tests you'd like to run
To run the main program, type: "./EKG_simulator", "./ETCO2_simulator" or "./display", depending on which programs you'd like to run

Please refer to image below for further guidance:
